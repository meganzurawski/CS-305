# CS-305 Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?


Artemis Financial, a company that offers financial planning services, needed help making their web software more secure. They asked for a vulnerability assessment to find and fix any security problems. I found important issues like weak input validation and encryption, and worked to improve the security of their software. This process taught me a lot about adding extra security layers, and I used tools like dependency-check plugins to ensure the software stayed safe after making changes. This project helped show my ability to find security problems, fix them, and make sure the software works well and is secure. Using these programs was difficult at times and hard to inport/export but I gave it my best to try and take in the information and execute what I could.
